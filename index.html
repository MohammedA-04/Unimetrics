          <br/<br/> We are creating a Universal Metric Converter for Students called <b>UniMetrics.</b> This website will made possible by <b>HTML</b> and <b>Replit</b> where we'll aim to create a unique metric converter for Academics and <18 Students One of strengthens is that we have unique selling point whereby our website will teach students how to convert metric aswell as calculate the answer for them<br/><br/>
            <br/>
              
            <div id=""><br/><h1>Why Unimetric?</h1>
            <br/<br/>Our motivation for developing this app is to create an easy to use, efficient metric convertor to allow students in all levels of education to have quick access to all types of conversions. We believe having a reliable effective app for students to rely on will help increase the productivity of students as they will no longer have to scour the internet only to find a add-ridden, confusing metric convertor and can focus entirely on their work.<br/><br/>
            <br/>
            Our inspiration of our project came from Calculator.net and Metric-conversion.org which are two renown metric converters within Metric Conversion Market. Upon inspected inspect of these metric conversion websites, the design of these pages was overloaded with information and not UI friendly with students (<18) who are usually the most common demographic who access these websites.</div>

            <!-- History of metric content -->
            The metric system is an international system used to measure weights, temperature, length, area, volume, speed, time, angle, engery and much more. The         <b>Frenchman Gabriel Mounton</b> is accreddited as the founding father of the metric system. In 1670 <b>Mouton</b> proposed the concept of a decimal system of measurement that which would be later refined by other French Scientists. The word "Metric" was inspired from the Greek word "Metron or measure". Which is where the metric called meter got it's name from.<br/><br/><br/>
            
            <!-- Break Line -->
            <b>FUN FACT:</b> Napolean himslef would even ban the system before it was offcially adopted by the French Government say metricmetal-history.<br/<br/><br/<br/>
            <!-- Break Line -->
            One of the earliest if not the first practical relisation of the metric system propsed by <b>Gaberial Mounton</b> was actualised in 1799 during time of Napolean               at which is when French Revolution was taking place. This move was after the existing system of mesures had become incovient and impractical on day-to-day basis for trade between people. Eventually it was replaced by a decimal system basing it on Kg (kilogram) & M (metre), these basic units were taken from the natural world
